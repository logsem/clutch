(* The Export'ed settings in this file are somewhat opinionated. A user loading
   Clutch might not want these. We should therefore be careful to
   only Require Import, and not Require Export this file. This unfortunately
   means that every single one of our files has to Require Import these
   settings. Currently we do not follow this practice, but if Clutch is
   released more widely we should. *)
