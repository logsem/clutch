  (** (Ignore) Trying to understand integrability *)

  (* See Rintegral to look for canonical definition of measure space on R? *)

  (* See @integrable *)

  (* Okay interesting. So in measure theory "integrable" does mean that both the positive and negative
     parts of a function have finite integral. However, the integral in mathcomp-analysis doesn't seem to
     define it this way, and it leads me to think that they're making a choice of how to define \infty - \infty *)

  (* I wonder what the lean version does. By this definition, the evaluation map _shouldn't_ be integrable on
     all sets for all measures... so then wheat is it's integral? *)

  (* I guess since theyre all positive functions, it's fine to define the integral of a function which
      takes values at \infty to be \infty... so we can reuse this version of the integral only if
        \infty - \infty = \infty
    *)

  (* Err... so is this an issue? If I take the integral of a measure, I should be able to prove that the
     negative part is always zero, right? *)


  (* Todo: try it. Plug a measure into the thing they use to restrict to negatives and see if you get 0 *)
  (* See how integrability is used... if it's just for lemmas then that's probably OK. *)
  (* If this "negative is always zero" thing turns out, then we can use the "unsafe" integral w/ no consequence *)

    So I think the strategy is to prove lemmas about funeneg and the opposite, then show that
    we can use nnintegral instead of integral for measures
