  HB.about realType.

  Check  @measurable_funP.

  (* Err... a measure is a function to an extended real type. *)

  (* Eventually I'll want to integrate whatever functions I call measurable *)
  (* So I need to see if (measurable_fun Giry... R‚àû) is enough for that or if I need to extend
     their integration theory to include extended functions. *)


  (* So the issue is, I'm wondering if a function with range \bar R can be integrable.

      Are there any other situations this might have come up? Fubini's theorem perhaps?

      Aha! It does come up in Fubini. So somewhere in there is a way to take an integral of an extended function.
   *)

  (* Actually wait, am I being stupid? The integrals I wrote above had ranges in ereals, so it's definitely possible*)
  (* Why did coq think that those functions were integrable? Did it think that they were measurable? How so? To R or \bar R? *)


  (* For fubini, they take
     Variables (f : X * Y -> \bar R) (f0 : forall xy, 0 <= f xy).
     Hypothesis mf : measurable_fun setT f.

      In particular, the range of f and g are \bar R and they have this explicit measurable_fun hypothesis,
     they don't get measurablility from the Hierarchy

   *)

  (* The ``section integral`` has f, g : T -> \bar R

      ... and nothing else? what?

   *)

  (* Well I suppose that's not too bad *)


  (* See Rintegral to look for canonical definition of measure space on R *)

  (* See @integrable *)

  (* Okay interesting. So in measure theory "integrable" does mean that both the positive and negative
     parts of a function have finite integral. However, the integral in mathcomp-analysis doesn't seem to
     define it this way, and it leads me to think that they're making a choice of how to define \infty - \infty *)

  (* I wonder what the lean version does. By this definition, the evaluation map _shouldn't_ be integrable on
     all sets for all measures... so then wheat is it's integral? *)

  (* I guess since theyre all positive functions, it's fine to define the integral of a function which
      takes values at \infty to be \infty... so we can reuse this version of the integral only if
        \infty - \infty = \infty
    *)

  Compute (+oo - +oo)%E.

  (* Dammit *)

  (* Err... so is this an issue? If I take the integral of a measure, I should be able to prove that the
     negative part is always zero, right? *)


  (* AFTER LUNCH: try it. Plug a measure into the thing they use to restrict to negatives and see if you get 0 *)
