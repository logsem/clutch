  (** (Ignore) Trying to understand integrability *)

  (* See Rintegral to look for canonical definition of measure space on R? *)

  (* See @integrable *)

  (* Okay interesting. So in measure theory "integrable" does mean that both the positive and negative
     parts of a function have finite integral. However, the integral in mathcomp-analysis doesn't seem to
     define it this way, and it leads me to think that they're making a choice of how to define \infty - \infty *)

  (* I wonder what the lean version does. By this definition, the evaluation map _shouldn't_ be integrable on
     all sets for all measures... so then wheat is it's integral? *)

  (* I guess since theyre all positive functions, it's fine to define the integral of a function which
      takes values at \infty to be \infty... so we can reuse this version of the integral only if
        \infty - \infty = \infty
    *)

  Compute (+oo - +oo)%E.

  (* Dammit *)

  (* Err... so is this an issue? If I take the integral of a measure, I should be able to prove that the
     negative part is always zero, right? *)


  (* Todo: try it. Plug a measure into the thing they use to restrict to negatives and see if you get 0 *)
  (* See how integrability is used... if it's just for lemmas then that's probably OK. *)
  (* If this "negative is always zero" thing turns out, then we can use the "unsafe" integral w/ no consequence *)
  (* See which lemmas are used in the proof of Fubini *)

  Check funeneg.

  (*
      Definition integral mu D f (g := f \_ D) :=
      nnintegral mu (g ^\+) - nnintegral mu (g ^\-).

    So I think the strategy is to prove lemmas about funeneg and the opposite, then show that
    we can use nnintegral instead of integral for measures

    This is the notion of measurability that we want? Actually wait... what are we doing again?
